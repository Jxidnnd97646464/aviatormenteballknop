# Aviator: The Ultimate Guide to Playing and Winning in India

## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a crash game developed by Spribe, a reputable provider in the
gambling industry. The game is based on a simple concept: a plane takes
off and flies higher and higher, while the multiplier increases. Players
must cash out before the plane crashes to win. The higher the
multiplier, the bigger the potential payout.
